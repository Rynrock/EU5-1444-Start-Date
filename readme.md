<h3>Some other notes</h3>

- 1444 was chosen as the start date for two main reasons: 

<ol>
    <li>I want to be able to get into colonization and the reformation quicker, and see more of the mid- and late-game.</li>
    <li>Any setup changes allow me to orient myself after EU4, instead of having to research a whole new time period.</li>
</ol>

- I was not able to figure out how to make the age of renaissance the starting age, if thats even possible. Therefore you'll be in the age of tradition until the first of december.
- The bubonic plague will immediately spawn upon game start. As to not open the can of worms that would be changing all pop numbers in Eurasia to post-plague levels, I'm just leaving this as is.
